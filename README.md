# PRS_tutorial
## INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this tutorial is to furnish a step-by-step guide on the execution of a Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) analysis, accompanied by an introduction to fundamental genetic principles germane to this methodology.

The tutorial is divided into two sections, First, a series of basic concepts about genetics and PRS are introduced at a theoretical level. Secondly, the tutorial itself consists of 6 steps which are detailed below.

**Step-by-step PRS analysis:**

0. [STEP 0: Data selection + QC check]()
1. [STEP 1: SNPs Extraction](1_CRC_SNPs.Rmd)
2. [STEP 2: SNPs Alignament check](target.md)
3. [STEP 3: Quality control (QC)](plink.md)
4. [STEP 4: PRS calculation](plink_visual.md)
5. [STEP 5: PRS resultsn](plink_visual.md)
